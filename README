| A Python library for parsing settings files, written in XML.           |
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

This aims to be a rather simple library - all it requires is the py-xml 
package, which is present in most default Python installs. Specifically,
it requires the xml.dom.minidom package.

The library was initially written as a way to parse settings files, which were 
kept in XML format, and represent them as a usable, native Python type. The 
intent here is to lessen the amount of knowledge of the Python xml package 
(and sub-packages) required when it comes to parsing XML files, and 
subsequently cut down on the amount of code required to parse XML files.
