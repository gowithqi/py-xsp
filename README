| A Python library for parsing XML files.                                |
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

py-xsp is a Python library which can transform XML documents into Python 
dictionaries.

The library was initially written as a way to parse settings files, which 
were kept in XML format, and represent them as a usable, native Python type. 
The intent here is to lessen the needed amount of knowledge of the Python xml 
package (and sub-packages) when it comes to parsing XML files, and 
subsequently cut down on the amount of code required to parse XML files.

Simply put, this library just adds a pleasant layer of abstraction for the 
xml.dom.minidom module, and turns parsing XML documents into a three-step 
process. (Three very simple steps, I might add.)
